<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Retro Raid started as an idea by Andrew Zambik for launching a site where the information for all games and consoles, modded and new, could be housed thus allowing users to have a one-stop shop of information for modifying consoles, cartridges, and more. Bringing on Jared Davis and Adrian Mike, the newly founded Dev Team decided to create forum that modeled the adventure aspect of video games and create a place where users donned a character and "raided" the "dungeons" (forums) to add their knowledge or learn something new. Finally, the team wanted to give back to the community by adding in a section devoted to trading, buying, and selling games and accessories to abandon the highly-inflated prices of new games or stored releases of older games.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
The start of this forum involved creating a dynamic space for users to post and respond. Initial setup was conducted using MERN and styling done through React-Bootstrap. 
Future developments in the works include:
1. Classifieds forum with integrated Venmo API to allow users to directly pay/request from others
2. Retro Raid Tokens as karma system to allow users to recognize others and buy features on the site
3. Administrator and Standard user profiles to allow greater moderation as user database grows
4. Hidden ad spaces to allow forum to support itself through ad revenue

See the [open issues](https://github.com/AZambik/retro-raid/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
